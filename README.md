# Kata tictactoe in JS

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ca8d9112ab5f446086c5c27f281b5703)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/undeadgrishnackh/tictactoe_js?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=undeadgrishnackh/tictactoe_js&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

very old kata I did to improve my expertise on JS. Actually it's so old that I need to fix a lot of security issues.
So I decided to publish it to perform some exercise to revamp the "legacy" code in a more modern and secure way.

the original JAVA kata is [here](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/tictactoe)
